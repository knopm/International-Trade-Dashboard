# International Trade Dashboard

*Final project by *Mikuláš Králíček* and *Matěj Knop* for the [(JEM207) Data Processing in Python course](https://github.com/iesfsv/Data-Processing-in-Python/).*

## Project proposal
The main goal of the project is to present data about the international trade in manner which is easy to comprehend, with the core outcome presented being pie charts (or their square versions) showing the import/export countries across different regions (continents)

Other information being shown might include indices about diversification of foreign trade or revealed comparative advantages. If we manage to do that we could try to implement some game features similarly to the Wordle inspired game Tradle (https://games.oec.world/en/tradle/). The data will mostly consist of BACI data from CEPII.

## Documentation
To be added.
